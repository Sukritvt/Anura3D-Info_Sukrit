# Fortran Resources

## Fortran Trivia
* The name came from **FOR**mula **TRAN**slation
  
## General Coding Help

1) [Compiled vs. Interpreted Language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compiled-and-interpreted-language/)
   * Info on the difference between a compiled (eg. Fortran, C++) and interpreted (eg. MATLAB, python) language

2) [Quick Info on Object Orientated Programming (OOP) in Fortan](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~dmandel/Fortran/Chap6.pdf)
   * Summary: Short introduction to OOP in Fortran. Has some good examples and details.

1) [Modern Fortran Tutorial Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05N6PecJw-E&list=PLOU8LxhyFylLS298Sea2-gYvO5Lj8HZsP)
    * Helpful video playlist on features of Fortran 
    * Introduction of Parallel computing in Fortran
    * Info on tools that make Fortran add-ons (eg. Fortran Package Manager (FPM), Interactive Fortrain (LFortran))
  
2)  [Learning Fortran in 2023-Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvUQndB8R9s)
    * Summary: (Not watched yet. just saw it)
  
### Websites
1) [Fortran Discourse Group](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/)

2) [Reddit page on learning Fortran](https://www.reddit.com/r/fortran/comments/utkjf8/resources_for_getting_good_at_fortran/)
   * Info on how to get started learning Fortran
  
3) [Wikipedia: Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran)
   * Info on the development and history of fortran
   * Info on different versions of Fortran 
   * Info on Modern Fortran (Which started in 2003 with the addtion of object-orientated programming)

### Fortran Add-Ons
1) [Running Fortran in Jupyter Notebooks](https://lfortran.org/)
   * Beta service that allows you to run Fortran in an interactive environment - Jupyter Notebook.
   * Might be helpful for initial code testing
   * Haven't tried it yet - watched a video on it

2) [Fortran Package Mangager (FPM)](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/)
    * [GitHub Link](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm)
    * Summary: "Fortran Package Manager (fpm) is a package manager and build system for Fortran. Its key goal is to improve the user experience of Fortran programmers. It does so by making it easier to build your Fortran program or library, run the executables, tests, and examples, and distribute it as a dependency to other Fortran projects. Fpm's user interface is modeled after Rust's Cargo, so if you're familiar with that tool, you will feel at home with fpm. Fpm's long term vision is to nurture and grow the ecosystem of modern Fortran applications and libraries."
