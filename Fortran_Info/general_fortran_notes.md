# Notes on Fortran (I need to organize this later)

1) Not on error stop
```fortran
error stop
```
error stop is allowed in pure procedures (Not limited to non-pure procedures) [Info on history of `error stop`](https://www.scivision.dev/fortran-stderr-stop-return-code)

## Notes on compilers
Looks like all of the compilers I'd use support Fortran 2018
