# Material Point Method (MPM) Resources

## Textbooks

1)  [The Material Point Method - Zhang et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780124077164/the-material-point-method)
      * "The Material Point Method: A Continuum-Based Particle Method for Extreme Loading Cases systematically introduces the theory, code design, and application of the material point method, covering subjects such as the spatial and temporal discretization of MPM, frequently-used strength models and equations of state of materials, contact algorithms in MPM, adaptive MPM, the hybrid/coupled material point finite element method, object-oriented programming of MPM, and the application of MPM in impact, explosion, and metal forming. Recent progresses are also stated in this monograph, including improvement of efficiency, memory storage, coupling/combination with the finite element method, the contact algorithm, and their application to problems. "
  
2) [The Material Point Method for Geotechnical Engineering](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9780429028090/material-point-method-geotechnical-engineering-james-fern-alexander-rohe-kenichi-soga-eduardo-alonso)
   * "This practical guide provides the best introduction to large deformation material point method (MPM) simulations for geotechnical engineering. It provides the basic theory, discusses the different numerical features used in large deformation simulations, and presents a number of applications -- providing references, examples and guidance when using MPM for practical applications."
