## Categories vs. Channels
### Categories
A Category is basically a folder. It can contain Channels, be that audio or text. 

### Channels
Channels are the actual chat rooms or audio/video rooms. They can exist inside of Categories or independently in the server. (:warning:**All channels should be created inside a Category. This will help organization and scrolling**:warning:) All channels have a purpose. A short snippet about the purpose of the channel is located at the top of the channel (See below).
